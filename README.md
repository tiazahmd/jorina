# Jorina
Jorina is a command line assistant created with Python 3.6. In my work and personal activities, I felt the need of an assitant who can help with some mundane stuff like weather or football scores. Jorina is a product of that need.

### Jorina's Modules
##### Version 1.0
Jorina is currently being initiated with the following modules:
- Weather
- Convert
- Football

Refer to the documentation folder for usage instructions.
